# Hi my name is Christian Otieno

## This is my Portfolio page code repository

- The website showcases some of my favorite projects in web development and the technologies I am best skilled at. It consists of a sticky right section that houses all the social links and what I am all about and a movable right section that contents the project presented in a list format.
